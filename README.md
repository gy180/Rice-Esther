# Rice-Esther

Work In Progress :)

Many people don't like the current Rice Esther student portal design.
Therefore, I redesign the Rice Esther page for fun because Rice Esther is hard to find things and looks like a page of links.

While the website is still a work in progress, the final product will resemble the prototype I created on figma (link below).

project involves html, node.js, and css.
